## Purpose
The purpose of the new process is to

- Resolve the priority conflict between fixing issues and writing software
- Have a model that can be iterated and improved upon as our priorities change

## How do I…

### Check to see if I have Blocker PRIs
Navigate to the Jira issues board for your team (links at the bottom of the page), there will be a swimlane at the top of this board called "Blocker PRI". If there are tickets that you need to work on then they will be assigned to you.

### Check to set if I have non-blocker PRIs
Navigate to the Jira issues board for your team (links at the bottom of the page), the second swimlane on the board called "Non-blocker PRI" will contain all of your issue. If there are tickets that you need to work on then they will be assigned to you.  

### Find the Team Issues board and assign myself the next ticket
Navigate to the Jira issues board for your team (links at the bottom of the page), the last swimlane on the board called "Everything Else" contain a list of issues prioritised by the Project Management team. Select the issue at the top of this list, assign it to yourself and move it to in progress.
