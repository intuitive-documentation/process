## How do I…
Navigate to your team board (see links above) and …

### Check to see if I have Blocker PRIs
You will find a swim-lane at the top of this board called "Blocker PRI". If there are tickets that you need to work on then they will be assigned to you.

### Check to set if I have non-blocker PRIs
There is a second swim-lane on the board called "Non-blocker PRI" will contain all of your issues. If there are tickets that you need to work on then they will be assigned to you.  

### Find the Team Issues board and assign myself the next ticket
